# Analyze
Matlab code to compute sound features from decompressed sound file.
Detailed info in the "projectDescription.pdf" file.
The main core of this project is to compute unique descriptors of a sound, which can describe the sound itself, which makes possible to understand what two different sound have in common. This similarity of features can bring to determinate common sources between different sounds.
